# expr
Experiment versioning: versioning the results of runs. Once an experiment class is defined, a folder with the name of the notebook (or code you're working with) will be created in the Results folder. Then, subsequent version folders will be created each time you run the code. Here is an example for test.ipynb experiment:

    .
    ├── Results
      ├── test                         # This folder will be created to store the results of each run for the test.ipynb.
        ├── v1                         # This folder will be created to store the results of first run of test.ipynb file.
            ├── output.log             # This file will be created to store the logged information of the test.ipynb file. 
            ├── test_image_v1.png      # This is a logged png file created by log_file method of the experiment class (example below).
            ├── test_result_v1.csv     # This is a logged csv file created by log_file method of the experiment class (example below).
            ├── test_image_v2.png      # This is version 2 (second run) of the same test_image file. 
            └── ...
Note that if you run a cell multiple times which includes a logged file (csv, png, etc.), the experiment version will stay the same, but the file version will be changed unless you specify overwrite_existing input as True.
        
To use the package, project should be organized into a combination of local files (which includes outputs and data and data dictionary) and code (which is your cloned git repo for the project).

### An example top-level directory layout

    .
    ├── project xyz               # Porject directory in your local system
      ├── Data                    # Data for the project, includes all data files
      ├── xyz                     # Cloned git repo for the project codes, includes all the code
        ├── cleaning              # Cleaning step
        ├── model_evaluation      # Model evaluation
        ├── Tuning                # Tuning step
        └── ...
      ├── Dicionary               # data dictionary for the project data
      ├── Results                 # Results folder for the outputs of experiments, results of each run will be stored here.
      └── README.md

## Usage
To start, import the package, and define an experiment. 
First, get the name of the notebook you're working with by running:
```
curr_notebook =  re.search('(.+).ipynb',os.path.basename(globals()['__vsc_ipynb_file__']))[1]
```
Alternatively, you can directly use the name of the file you're working with.

Next, use experiment class to define a new class for your experiment (run) by:
```
expr = experiments.experiment(curr_notebook, overwrite_existing=False)
```

To log a message, use:
expr.log("This is a logged message.")

To wirte a file (image, excel, etc.) you'll need to log the file first by using log_file function:
```
FileName_excel = expr.log_file('Test_excel_file.xlsx')
```
Then, you can use the FileName_excel variable in the ExcelWriter:
```
writer = pd.ExcelWriter(FileName_excel)
```

### Read data or file
To read data you can use read_data method of the experiment class:
```
expr.read_data('BMT_HR_dict')
```
You don't need to specify the format of the file. The method will read the latest version of the data unless specified otherwise. Currently this method supports csv and xlsx formats and it uses pandas read_csv and read_excel functions to read these two types of data.
